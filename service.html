              <p class="vaccines">Vaccines are possible when the resources allow us to distribute the rabies vaccine to pets and stray animals; we also deworm cats and dogs in the community.We do not want a scared dog to bite a person and infect them if the dog has the rabies virus. In addition, we do not need a group of dogs to get infected.Stray dogs are victims of dog attacks; they fight for food, and playtime turns into hostility. They get hurt or can get infected with other dog's viruses
