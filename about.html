          <h3>GROOMING</h3>
          <p class="p-2" style="font-size: 15px;">Grooming your dog is an important part of a dog's overall health. Nails that are too long can shift a dog's posture and create structural problems down the line and teeth that have never seen a brush can be lost. Not to mentioned that a matted, unruly coat can cause many health issues.   So make sure your pooch is feeling happy and healthy with a nice new do from our talented groomers!</p>

          <h3>VACCINES</h3>
          <p class="p-2" style="font-size: 15px;">Vaccines are possible when the resources allow us to distribute the rabies vaccine to pets and stray animals; we also deworm cats and dogs in the community.We do not want a scared dog to bite a person and infect them if the dog has the rabies virus. In addition, we do not need a group of dogs to get infected.Stray dogs are victims of dog attacks; they fight for food, and playtime turns into hostility. They get hurt or can get infected with other dog's viruses

          <h3>DOG WALKINGS</h3>
          <p class="p-2" style="font-size: 15px;">You can't always predict a super busy day at work, but you can anticipate your dog's needs.
